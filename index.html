          Hello everyone my name is Edward. I am a hardworking and enthusiastic college student working towards a bachelorâ€™s degree in theater, film, and digital production.I would describe myself as dedicated, hardworking, and a dependable member of any team. I am always willing to learn and push myself to become the best version of myself. <br>
          I am currently a member of R'shorts a small film club at my university where I have the opportunity to be on film production sets. I am currently working on the film production set of Delilah  as a grip and am extremely excited to be a part of that project. I have huge love for film and my goal is to translate that enthusiasm into a digestible and enjoyable work. I pride myself on my ability to constantly grow and improve upon my own filmmaking. I am learning to become a director and I also write mini scripts on my own to build up my own writing and creative skills.<br> 
Over the fall and summer I interned at Jay N Jay studios, an independent film studio out of Provo Utah. Over there I had the ability to partner up with a fellow writer and write scripts for a mini series known as Fan theory for the independent studio. Additionally as a social media intern I had the opportunity to edit and direct small videos as content for their tik tok page which has amassed over 273k followers '@liveactionavatar'. Through that internship I polished my video editing skills and was able to develop an advanced understanding of After effects, imovie and marketing patterns that drove up the studio's social media presence. <br>
In high school I had the opportunity to part of a pilot program for entrepreneurship program. Partnering with Boston Consulting Group Digital Ventures, I had the opportunity to create my own startup with industry professionals and lead a UI/UX and a Product manager into creating a mobile ios application known as Homefoo. A startup bringing home cooked meals to underprivileged college students. In the program I learned the fundamentals of entrepreneurship, and pitched Homefood to a panel of judges where I won the creative concept award. I learned how to create income flows within a startup, overcoming barriers of entry, understanding target audiences, building mission statements. In this mentorship program I learned the fundamentals of business and was able to learn the specific types of mindsets, and cultures that startups have to create in order to become successful. Additionally it was a great networking opportunity where we were able to see professionals in their own environment.
